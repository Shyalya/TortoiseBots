# Migration evidence log (plan §6 A01–A16, §15 P01–P26)

Rule: compilation, source presence and command ACKs never close a runtime gate.
Every scenario below needs fixture + revision/data/config + steps + observed results.
Status values: `pending` | `pass` | `fail` | `blocked(reason)`.

## M1 decision-trail evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m1-diagnostics)

### Emitter grammar (implemented and compiled in ON + DISABLED build matrix)

- `Engine::DoNextAction`: TICK carries `state=` + `strats=`; T/PUSH/A lines carry
  `src=` (+ `base=`/`eff=` on A lines); non-1.0 multiplier factors logged as MULT lines.
- `PlayerbotAI::CastSpell` unit/GO/coordinate overloads: CAST_START + CAST_OK/FAIL
  `phase=PREPARE*`; 7 CAST_GATE early-exit reasons (self-harmful, pet-redirect,
  flying, stand-or-facing-delay, moving-jump-fall, moving-no-master, loot-impossible).
- Coordinate overload result still ignored by design (M3 owns the fix); now logged
  as `phase=PREPARE-coord-ignored` so rejected ground casts are visible.
- All behavior paths preserved (diff review: every early-return intact; the one
  dropped `return false` introduced mid-edit was restored before commit).

### Checker

- `tools/check_decision_trail.py --self-test`: PASS (grammar + UNKNOWN, stale-retry?,
  multiplier-zero, cast-fail/gate signatures + malformed-line detection + R1 spaced-source fixtures).
- R1 parser defect resolved: event sources containing spaces parsed cleanly on T, PUSH, and A lines;
  numeric `base` and `eff` values preserved.
- Production-log run pending server execution; `--strict` gates M1 runtime closure.

### Findings

- No module-visible EFFECT-phase completion signal exists (free-function hooks in
  BotActionLog.cpp have no callers; core owns spell effects). Generic core
  completion/failure proposal deferred to M3/M10 with this evidence — not dropped.
- Disabled cost: `Open()` returns null when `EnableActionLog=0` (BotActionLog.cpp:95);
  disabled Write = mutex + map miss + flag branch (+ one spell-map lookup for LogCast*).
  Measurement pending server run.
- A log label never converts an attempt into a successful heal/interrupt; A05/A07/A08
  remain pending real-client observation.

## M2 engine-mapping evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m2-engine)

Three read-only mapping scouts (generic 53 files, 9 class dirs, queue/trigger/reaction spec)
plus parent verification of Strategy.h/Strategy.cpp/CombatStrategy.h.

- Dual-hook verdict: no strategy implements both forms with content. Generic files are
  legacy-list-only; modern vector hooks are `{}` everywhere (explicit blockers only in
  CombatStrategy.h/NonCombatStrategy.h). Class dirs are single-form-or-placeholder
  (spec bare names contribute zero hooks; rotation attaches via strategiesToUpdate).
  Intra-legacy same-names across states are by-design per-state registration; the
  dispatcher calls exactly one state branch per Init. No hook retired.
- Tie: `Queue::Pop` strict-`>` first-max-wins (Queue.cpp:35-61); queue identity is
  name-only, so an equal-relevance changed-target push keeps the older basket/event.
- Minimal `break` vs donor `continue`: Tortoise defers the queue intact (bounded);
  donor re-peeks to budget exhaustion. Deliberate fix, preserved.
- Parity (donor-identical, no change): trigger latch/cadence/Check/Reset pump,
  RemoveExpired rule (ExpireActionTime=5000 default), PushAgain +0.02/+0.01/+0.03
  offsets, ReactionEngine body (>100U active, no preemption, interrupt-on-discovery
  only), UpdateAI reaction gating, SetActionDuration routing.
- Donor-only machinery NOT ported (no proven need): failure-retry/generation guards,
  testMode gate, PerfMon spans, forceActivity/teleport/AFK wrapper extras are
  Tortoise-side and preserved.
- Runtime proof of the required M2 case list (two-triggers-one-action, expired target,
  reset-during-execution, Stay→Follow, repeated pulls, no-action tick, minimal
  emergency) needs a server run; the M1 checker grammar covers trail-shape only.

## M3 spell/talent/shim evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m3-spells)

Three read-only audits plus parent verification of every fixed native contract.

- Coordinate fix: `CastSpell(x,y,z)` ignored `prepare()` and returned true. Now
  returns false on rejection; CastCustomSpellAction callers fall through to
  self-cast fallback instead of announcing phantom ground casts.
- Rank parity: Tortoise/ donor rank blocks functionally identical (pet-field and
  IsHighRank alias noise only). Mana-save numeric walk is real-but-bounded risk,
  unreachable at default saveMana 1.0; chain data inspectable in
  tw_world_spell_chain.sql, Rank labels need client DBC extraction.
- isUseful stage: donor HasSpell/vehicle gates fail faster; Tortoise defers to
  isPossible with the SAME winner (holy-shock→holy-light, regrowth→touch,
  repentance→shield→light fallbacks quoted). Kept permissive; revisit only on
  trail-measured reach waste.
- Staleness: spell-id value 5s TTL + context Reset cover values; action-member
  spellId has no TTL. Worst case bounded + self-healing; no change without compile.
- Talents: largest-tree + pre-10 defaults; bear/cat forced-role-first at primary
  site; owned builds preserved (IsOwnedBot guards); rebuild via snapshots+reset.
  Gaps: RacialsStrategy classic-only (Goblin/High Elf racials absent); secondary
  feral sites use Primal-Fury/coin-flip.
- Shim D1/D3/D4/D5 fixed, each with quoted native header + exhaustive caller list.
  D2 (TARGET_FLAG_LOCKED) deferred for DBC-mask evidence. D6 left (defensible).
  IsSpellReady narrowness, isMoving approximation, distance hysteresis, collapsed
  flags, SEC mapping, quest writers — all classified by-design with rationale.

## M4 party-tactics evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m4-party)

Three read-only audits plus parent verification of every touched path.
Two scout claims corrected by direct source check.

- Targets: explicit-command > RTI > role scan (Dps/TankTargetValue); lazy
  invalidation (world/map/selection/desync/death/own-death); reach prerequisite
  rebuilt per tick from spell+target (no stored Unit, no cross-cast staleness).
- CC: PossibleAttackTargets strips breakable/unbreakable CC before selection;
  FindTarget consumes the stripped list. The reported AoE-anchor hole does not
  exist (candidate set pre-stripped); residual splash is spell-choice scope.
- Pull: Tortoise completion marker + anchor pullback improve on donor
  timeout-only; owner-disappears bounded by 15s cap in both trees.
- Interrupt/CC commands: capability probe → revalidate → direct exec → queued
  PASSTHROUGH=100 fallback with mature reach → forced tick. No side engine,
  no class table. CORRECTION: main-engine queue DOES expire (Engine.cpp:407).
- Guard/Free fix: shortcuts bypassed the central setter (NC+C only), leaving
  reaction-follow stale. Now routed via SetMovementStrategy; Reset and guard
  position bookkeeping preserved. (One dropped Reset() caught + restored pre-commit.)
- Formation: value swap + single FOLLOW clear + MoveFollow dedup = no churn.
- Summon binding-order wart noted, unchanged (needs runtime harm proof).
- Heal urgency/dispel/rez mapped (PartyMemberToHeal tiers, incoming adjustment,
  anti-double-heal reservation, dispel order, rez conflict guard); no rank
  optimizer exists (highest-known unless mana-save) — C-PRI follow-up in M5/M6.

## M5 slice-audit evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m5-slices)

Five read-only slice audits (one re-dispatched after a placeholder response).
No ports: implementation needs compile+runtime, both unavailable here.

- WarProt: full rotation inventoried; tank alias→placeholder→protection-pve
  activation; legacy Tank file inert. Gaps: CC-only interrupts, missing
  vigilance/ranged-pull/intervene, sunder>5 risk, TBC-legality checks each.
- PriestHoly: bucket ladder + PoH group AoE + dispel/rez/mana/shadow ladders;
  rank=highest-known CONFIRMED, no optimizer. Donor gaps all TBC (correctly
  absent). SW:Death kept — verify Tortoise backport; prayer-of-spirit likewise.
- Mage: proc-blind core (WotLK N/A); fire-locked fallback; loop-guards verified
  on all vectors. TBC re-adopt list (ice lance/arcane blast/spellsteal/
  invisibility/water elemental) needs per-item Tortoise legality.
- Rogue: thresholds + opener guards + fallbacks verified; no pooling/reservation
  (Tortoise-applicable donor-mature — queued); expose-armor wire-or-remove.
- Hunter: active ZERO-vanilla stack verified (dead-zone, traps, aspects, ammo);
  specs pass-through; feed-pet STUB; distracting/wyvern dead regs. PET-CC FIX
  applied (pet respects CC strip). Inert Generic files (disengage+flee) must
  never be registered — recorded as guard, files untouched.
- Party runtime (human+4bots, rotating slots, dungeon with pulls/CC/interrupts/
  loot/recovery) remains the M5 gate; exact user steps deferred to pre-runtime.

## M6 class-audit evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m6-classes)

Four read-only audits; parent verified every fix. No ports.

- Paladin: dual-arch (old vector + new list) with priority arbitration, blessing
  role tables, fallback chains. FIX: Pve-combat blessing used PvP tables
  (copy-paste; Raid-combat already uses pve). Gaps: ArtOfWar dead trigger,
  untalented single-action fizzles, CC eligibility delegated to generic value.
- Shaman: OLD+NEW parallel implementations; shock without interrupt branch;
  totem rank tables + exclusions; chain-heal AoE-only; earth-shield raid-only;
  reincarnation unhandled. Leaks: range-mismatch churn, HaveAnyTotem no-owner
  suppression, triggers-while-moving, air-totem double registration.
- Druid: forced-alias arbitration reconciled across layers (role-first in
  factory, Primal-Fury fallback, THICK_HIDE/cat-form triggers). Gaps:
  lifebloom/starfall re-adopt, dangling triggers, prowl gates, bear charge.
- Warlock: Life-Tap double-guarded; no DoT lifetime guard; shard create/destroy
  triggers are dead wiring (no creators); pet spell-lock stack. Caught the
  banish hole in the M5 pet guard → extended with IsImmuneToDamage.
- Matrix: 9/9 classes audited. No applicable tree falls back to an unrelated
  strategy (placeholders contribute zero hooks; rotation attaches via update
  wiring). Raid-specific role checks deferred to M8.

## M7 world-utility evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m7-world)

Eight read-only audits (one blacklist fix, two taxi fixes). No ports.

- Quests: owner-assisted + autonomous journeys complete in source; cheats
  cheat-gated both sides; blacklist parity restored (Malkovich 50000);
  SyncQuestForPlayer missing from conf template (gap); escort/scripted driver
  absent both sides (parity, record honestly); full-log handling lossy.
- RPG: Shyalya crowd/RNG/patrol/taxi-cheat corrections identified, queued for
  compilable env (behavioral, need build). Avoid-list absent, avoid-area
  fail-closed, spell-click absent with zero Tortoise core support found.
- Travel: purposes/costs/failed-edges/faction gates mapped; MinimalMove now
  retains rejected legs; RpgTaxi restores funding on all 4 reject paths;
  generators force-off (no PathInfo area query); empty tables degrade safely.
- Loot: full path map; H1-H7 hazards recorded as known limits; D1 admission
  permission is a host gap (Penqle has AllowedForPlayer per-item but no
  CanLoot; late skip prevents theft) — deferred, not bypassed.
- Gear: steady-state idempotent, first-init single-shot, full-randomize
  uncalled; modern item managers correctly not ported.
- Professions/pets: 3-layer coverage; feed stub is donor parity (all three
  cheat identically) — real-food is enhancement scope, not migration debt;
  stabling absent-by-design; train-pet gap; relog/travel via native+triggers.
- Population: mode table + precedence recorded; first-init pipeline (G1/G2),
  distribution weights (G5), event machine + clock-shift (L2/L6/L7), dynamic
  target (L1), revive/teleport scheduling (L4/L5) all MISSING — M9 scope.
- Data: clean-install safe everywhere; owned data never dropped; datasets need
  operator import workflow (F22). Buff/chat at exact parity (both inert via
  GetValues/Generate stubs); LoginCriteria also starved — F20 fix covers both.

## M8 content evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m8-content)

Three read-only audits; parent verified every fix. No DungeonClear contact.

- Raids: MC rune-movement/GO IDs match Tortoise core (douse needs no item
  core-side — bot item requirement may fail closed; noted); BWL suppression
  GO/aura match but bot path is rogue-only while core allows any class;
  Onyxia fight strategy EMPTY (generic participation only); 4H teardown name
  fixed + Naxx enter/leave wired (all names verified registered); void-zone
  trigger/action have no creators (new classes needed — deferred to compilable
  env); most bosses in every raid have zero tactics. No encounter claims.
- Tortoise: 6 dungeon dirs + SV inventoried (30 mechanic rows with NPC/spell
  IDs); zero bespoke bot tactics; LFT demand-fill aliases cover 4 maps
  (no Lower/Upper Kara, no SV). KARAZHAN CMake guard would reject valid Tortoise
  Kara files verbatim — narrowing queued for M10 (needs file-by-file review).
- BGs: WSG flag play, AB node assault/defense with stickiness, AV objective
  tables mapped; death/spirit rules; interference guards hold. SV (id5) and
  BR arena (id4) have zero tactics; Eye/Isle correctly absent. Autonomous
  BG queue absent by design (demand-only).

## M9 services evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m9-services)

Three read-only audits; parent verified every fix. No ports.

- AH: personal sell/bid/buy intact via session handlers but price-blind;
  lowest-buyout now true per-unit min. Full market = 12-capability gap vs
  SAH; companion core seam specified (paged snapshot + Guard for F09 races;
  MarketPost/Bid/Expire reusing native persistence/mail for F10 synthetic
  supply). No direct map/DB writes in module; no fake parity.
- Groups/guilds: formation→accept→leave→release + charter→orders flows
  mapped; durable vs transient ownership distinguished; hardcore/level-gate
  gaps; modern task-loop surface queued.
- LFT: demand-only verified; role = talent-enum (kit check queued);
  autonomous grouping absent by design; conf comment corrected to hardcoded
  addon table.
- Scheduling: NO central arbitrator — emergent fail-closed guards; F25 retry/
  backoff absent; solo-idle triple-eligibility + restart orphans recorded;
  per-tick cleanliness verified by inspection; measurement plan written with
  stages/metrics/assertions, numbers pending runtime.

## M10 closure evidence (2026-09-07, branch migration/m10-closure)

Three read-only audits; parent verified the GetValues fix. No ports.

- Controls: uncovered donor commands listed (holder/maintenance/ops/modern);
  selectors limited to selectedBot/partyBots; bulk single-ACK; F17 gaps
  (no .bot preset ops, no version/migration diagnostics); F18 BLOCKED with
  seam verdict (PlayerAI is not a control seam).
- Trade/config: native-routed except GuildBank stub; mail send/COD/return
  absent; GetValues FIXED via native GetRootSections/GetKeys + dotted-family
  + first-match rules (module-only, no core change; complete Config.h chain
  verified). Operator surface is whisper-only debug/help/log (no reload/
  status/test). tweakValue unconsumed; guildMaxBotLimit key mismatch noted.
- Addon: 5 server-without-UI gaps; discovery stub fail-open; mature-forward
  hidden. Ledger tally: 102 rows, zero tested-without-evidence overclaims;
  placeholder/dup/malformed rows fixed. KARAZHAN narrowing specified
  (exempt Lower/Upper/Crypt paths; no edit without file review + build).
- F26: this stack is AUDIT + targeted-fix state, not parity. Full parity
  requires compile, disposable journeys, user playtest, and the blocked/
  deferred items above. No scope silently reduced: every applicable row has
  a disposition; blocked/deferred stay open.

## Independent review responses (2026-09-07, three reviewer agents)

- ReviewEngineCast: CAST_OK inversion CONFIRMED + FIXED (tag now uses the
  0xFF symbol; 0x00 failure no longer logs as success). All other items
  PASS (returns, braces, varargs, BotState coverage, multiplier semantics,
  coord paths, no extra behavior change).
- ReviewShimConfig: keys-vs-values CONFIRMED + FIXED (loader parses keys);
  sub-copper sentinel CONFIRMED + FIXED (1c floor); shim mappings all PASS
  against native headers; conf edit PASS comment-only.
- ReviewBehavior: 6/7 PASS. Void-zone FAIL stands as recorded deferred gap:
  the 4H node resolves to null and Engine skips it silently (verified
  ProcessTriggers null-continue, no crash); generic hazard plumbing is
  entry-driven with no void-zone producer, so no string swap would help.
  New trigger/action classes need a compilable environment.
- NOTE: external uncommitted Vanilla-purity edits appeared mid-review in
  the working tree (denylist widening, subclass-label pruning, druid/
  rogue/warlock deletions). Not authored, committed, or reverted here;
  stack rebases wait for owner confirmation.

## Build evidence (2026-09-07, singular branch)

- ON matrix (`BUILD_PLAYERBOTS=ON MODULES=static
  MODULE_TORTOISEBOTS=static`, pristine branch-tip basis + core
  c12bb16e): image `tortoise-wow-penqle:local` BUILT successfully.
  Full module graph compiles, including trail, coord fix, shim,
  GetValues, Guard/Free, pet guard, blessings, taxi, Naxx wiring.
  Binary probe: `ai::` symbols + `aiplayerbot.conf` present.
- One real defect caught by the compiler (missed by all reviewers):
  pet-guard predicates were private; published in
  PossibleAttackTargetsValue.h (fix commit on the branch).
- CORRECTION 2026-09-07: the so-called OFF run (defaults) did NOT disable
  the module — identical image hash because MODULES=static (compose
  default) + source/modules/TortoiseBots presence drives inclusion, and
  BUILD_PLAYERBOTS does not gate it. A true absent-matrix build
  (MODULES=disabled) is running to prove the optional-module invariant.

## Owner cleanup merge #82 (2026-09-07, on singular branch as f34cd184)

- Owner merged `cleanup/remove-expansion-leftovers-20260907` (b9150f54)
  into `migration/behavior-migration`, past my c8444464; my evidence commit
  rebased cleanly on top (no conflicts; disjoint files). Unrelated tree
  edits from earlier in the day were reverted by their owner, not by me.
- Content (all DBC-verified by owner): druid Lacerate/Survival
  Instincts/Maim/FoN/Typhoon removals, rogue Dismantle, warlock Incinerate,
  TBC/WotLK SuggestWhatToDo rows, item-subclass label trims, denylist
  += OUTLAND|NORTHREND.
- Gap impact (my audit rows now partially superseded): C-DRU dangling
  typhoon/FoN/maim + simplified-lacerate items CLOSED by deletion;
  warlock Incinerate registration question CLOSED; TBC instance-row
  cleanup aligns with M8 exclusion scope. Verified zero dangling
  references (case-insensitive grep over ai/): strategies referencing the
  removed names were removed in the same commit.
- Denylist widening does not collide with the KARAZHAN narrowing spec
  (different name families; JEWEL/EMBLEM/HEROIC deliberately excluded).
- Build impact: the earlier ON image predated the merge; the rebuild on the
  merged tip (see matrix results below) supersedes it — current tip compiles.

## Build matrix results (2026-09-07, final)

- ON, merged tip (branch `migration/behavior-migration` @ b1552ecb basis
  incl. owner cleanup #82): image BUILT. All migration code + cleanup
  compiles and links. (One earlier defect — private predicates — fixed.)
- DISABLED (`MODULE_TORTOISEBOTS=disabled`): image BUILT; binary probe
  shows 0 tortoisebots symbols, no `aiplayerbot.conf`, no modules etc —
  core builds and ships without the module. Optional-module invariant HOLDS.
- Correction history (kept for honesty): a defaults-only run was first
  misread as OFF, but compose defaults keep MODULE_TORTOISEBOTS=static;
  the per-module flag, not MODULES, gates inclusion. True-disabled run
  above supersedes it.

## Void-zone wiring (2026-09-07, singular branch)

- Implemented `FourHorsemanVoidZoneTrigger : CloseToCreatureHazardTrigger`
  (entry 16697 from core `boss_four_horsemen.cpp:567`, 90s TEMPSUMMON) and
  `FourHorsemanMoveAwayFromVoidZoneAction : MoveAwayFromHazard`, both
  registered. The strategy's existing `void zone too close` node now
  resolves instead of silent-skipping.
- Radius 10.0f is a stated conservative estimate (no DBC/script radius in
  evidence); duration 90 matches the summon lifetime. Retune from T: lines
  after the first real 4H run. Encounter competence still needs runtime.

- COMPILE PROOF 2026-09-07: ON-matrix image rebuilt on the wiring tip and
  the shipped `mangosd` binary contains both `void zone too close` and
  `move away from void zone` registrations. Silent-drop closed at the
  wiring level; encounter competence still gated on a real 4H run.

## 4H void-zone acceptance script (pending runtime)

Setup: human + bot party inside Naxxramas at the Four Horsemen, trail on
(`AiPlayerbot.EnableActionLog=1`), Lady Blaumeux alive and casting.
1. Wait for a void zone summon near a bot. Expect trail:
   `T:void zone too close src=` then `PUSH:move away from void zone`
   then `A:move away from void zone - OK`.
2. Observe the bot leave the zone; expect no `CAST_GATE`/`A:*-FAILED`
   storm and no re-entry within the same summon lifetime.
3. If the trigger never fires while a bot stands in a visible void zone,
   capture map/position/entry (expect 16697) + trail — radius retune input.
4. If it fires with no void zone nearby, capture target entry + distance —
   false-positive input (entry or radius wrong).
Pass = avoidance with no stall; fail artifacts listed above tune the wiring.
